# LUDO
**Ludo** is strategy board game, which can be played by 2 to 4 players with each player having a set of 4 pieces (usually identified by color) placed in the starting zone, which is at the left corner for each player. By rolling the dice, players race their four pieces on the board from start to finish, while trying to avoid being killed or captured by their opponents.

The main objective for each player is to move all his/her tokens or pieces to the finish before his/her opponents. Of course, en-route there are some more obstacles that the player has to overcome.
